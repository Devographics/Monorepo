# Devographics Monorepo

## Setup

#### 1. Install pnpm

This monorepo uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), and you should start by installing it.

#### 2. Clone monorepo

Clone this monorepo locally and install all dependencies with `pnpm i`.

#### 3. Clone other repos

Optionally, you can also clone these other repos if you want to load or modify their data locally:

1. [entities](https://github.com/Devographics/entities): the YAML files containing all metadata for the features, sites, people, libraries, etc. mentioned in the surveys.
2. [surveys](https://github.com/Devographics/surveys): contains the YAML files that define survey configs and outlines.
3. [locale-en-US](https://github.com/Devographics/locale-en-US): (or any other locale) contains the locale strings used in the survey.

I suggest using the following file structure:

-   `devographics` parent directory
    -   `devographics/monorepo`
        -   `devographics/monorepo/surveyform`
        -   `devographics/monorepo/results`
        -   `devographics/monorepo/...`
    -   `devographics/entities`
    -   `devographics/surveys`
    -   `devographics/locales`
        -   `devographics/locales/locale-en-US`
        -   `devographics/locales/locale-fr-FR`
        -   `devographics/locales/...`

#### 4. Set environment variables

Each app within `monorepo` needs its own environment variables defined inside an `.env` files (except for `surveyform` and `surveyadmin`, which use `.env.development.local`).

When running the app (see next section) you will get error messages indicating which environment variables are required.

Alternatively you can also refer to [variables.yml](https://github.com/Devographics/Monorepo/blob/main/shared/helpers/variables.yml) and look for variables corresponding to the current app (e.g. `results`).

You can also refer to the README in each individual app directory (`results/README.md`, etc.).

#### 5. Running the apps

You can run the apps with `pnpm run dev` when inside `monorepo/surveyform`, `monorepo/results`, etc.
