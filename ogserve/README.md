# Deprecated experiment

This is a demonstration of how we could
generate and render chart open graph image on the fly

It turns out that this would involve reusing most of the logic
from the "results" Gatsby app

=> it's more efficient to completely rewrite this result app with Next.js
and include open graph serving from there

See "charts" for a more up-to-date version

/!\ Do not delete this code yet (migration in progress)
